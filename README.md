 INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a factory for making PacMen. When the button "Add PacMan" is pressed, it will add a new image of a pac man to the screen.

When the button "Star Game" is pressed, the images of the Pac Men will start moving and bouncing accross the screen.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The code for the current assignments only requires access to a web browser.

HOW TO RUN
------------
In order to run this project, please download all the files and place them all in the same folder, then open the index.html file. 

ROADMAP OF FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------
In the future, I am planning on adding a better look and feel so the page doesn't look so flat and might improve the area where the PacMen bounce

MAINTAINERS
------------
This project is maintained by Miriam Bade.
